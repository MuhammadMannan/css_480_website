# CSS 480 Personal Website

## PoC: Hello World

What to Do
You will create a basic home page for a website that is available to the class via a URL. You can use the web hosting service of your choice. The UW has listed web publishing options for students here: https://itconnect.uw.edu/guides-by-topic/online-storage-publishing/web-publishing/. If you already have a personal website, you can reuse that - just create a new page as your CSS 480 landing page.

Satisfy the following requirements for your "Hello World" website:

Must-Have Functional Requirements:
1. The home page should welcome visitors with a warm welcome message of text.

2. The home page should let visitors know who you are. This should be a short written narrative and at least 1 image.

3. The home page should have at least one list of things that interest you.

4. The home page should have a button that lets the user re-order a list.

Must-Have Non-Functional Requirements:
1. The website is built using React.js.

2. There are a variety of React frameworks available. You can use the framework of your choice, such as Next.js. We recommend hosting with Vercel especially if you use GitHub and Next.js. But you can use any hosting service you'd like.
